When you are discussing a “Disaster Plan” with your family, it is best to include two places to meet. One place nearby your home, in case of sudden emergency (such as a fire or earthquake) and a second place outside your area, in case you are not permitted to return home or are asked to evacuate.

Dehydrated and freeze-dried food should be rehydrated before consumption.

The “Good Samaritan Law” in the U.S. protects those who deliver healthcare services in an emergency situation when:
* the individual delivering the services is a volunteer
* acts w/n her level of ability
* acts within her scope of practice
