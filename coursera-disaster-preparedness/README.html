<p>When you are discussing a “Disaster Plan” with your family, it is best to include two places to meet. One place nearby your home, in case of sudden emergency (such as a fire or earthquake) and a second place outside your area, in case you are not permitted to return home or are asked to evacuate.</p>
<p>Dehydrated and freeze-dried food should be rehydrated before consumption.</p>
<p>The “Good Samaritan Law” in the U.S. protects those who deliver healthcare services in an emergency situation when:</p>
<ul>
<li>the individual delivering the services is a volunteer</li>
<li>acts w/n her level of ability</li>
<li>acts within her scope of practice</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="disaster-plans">Disaster Plans</h1>
<h2 id="personal-background-information">1. Personal Background information</h2>
<p><em>Describe the number of family members, unique needs or considerations (e.g., ages of family members, pets, or health issues), and geographic location.</em></p>
<p>We have a 2.5 y old baby that need special care. My wife would need sanitary supplies.</p>
<p>We live close to the bay but not too close about 4 miles. However there is a canal close to us running to the bay. But the flooding risk should be low, as the San Fransico bay area has not much rain. On the other hand we are prone to earth quakes.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-disasters">2. Types of Disasters</h2>
<p><em>Describe the types of disasters that are most likely to occur in your area. How will the type of disaster impact your preparation?</em></p>
<p>potential disasters include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Earthquakes</li>
<li>Mountain fire</li>
<li>Flu/Pandemics</li>
<li>Utility outages</li>
<li>Fires</li>
<li>Chemical spills</li>
</ul>
<p>My area is generally safe. The earthquake may be the biggest threat, but our buildings should stand ordinary quakes. We plan to shelter in place if it happens. Or camp outside our backyard in case the house is danger to live in.</p>
<h2 id="home-preparedness-and-jump-kit-checklists">3. Home Preparedness and Jump Kit Checklists:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The “Home Preparedness Kit” is your large kit stored in a cool, dry place within your home. It should prepare your to survive in your home for 3 to 7 days without outside aid. Items will likely include food, water, bedding, tools (be specific), important records, insurance policies, contact list, medications, first aid, entertainment materials, and cash/financial needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Food: We have several canned foods such as spam, also some dried foods such as cookies, vitamin pills.</li>
<li>medical supplies: a bag full of ordinary medicines and colds. bandages. alcohol wipes.</li>
<li>water: bottled water. water in 1 gal boxes.</li>
<li>firearms: shotgun; ammunition; knife; utility knife; sharpening supplies</li>
<li>sanitation: toothpaste/brush; small shampoo.</li>
<li>import documents: passports; driver licence; titles to house; contact list; cash</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A “Jump Kit” is a pre-packed bag that includes basic care items, which allows you to act quickly in an emergency. Think of a Jump Kit as a grab-and-go bag. Develop a Jump Kit Checklist that lists items to pack in the event of an emergency such as food, water, change of clothes, important records, insurance policies, contact list, medications, and cash/financial needs. Some people keep their Jump Kit in their car.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All the same but smaller amount.</p>
<ul>
<li>Food: 2 cans for spam</li>
<li>medical supplies:</li>
<li>water: water filters; one gal of water in car.</li>
<li>Firearms/tools: handgun; Swiss army knife; radio</li>
<li>Import documents: same as above</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="contingency-plans">4. Contingency Plans</h2>
<p><em>Disasters sometimes occur when you are at work and members of your family are at work or school. Could you leave work? Develop a plan for picking up children (or other family members) and both a local and an out of town meeting place.</em></p>
<p>We work from home now. So most probably we will be at home together.</p>
<h2 id="escape-routes-or-transportation-plan">5. Escape Routes or Transportation Plan</h2>
<p><em>Provide a plan for leaving your home and the area, including information about where you will go and how you will get there.</em></p>
<p>For general earth quake stay in place, wait for help. For bigger disaster possible airports OAK north, SFO west crossing bridge, SJC south; depending which direction is safe to go to. We could also drive car with full tank of gas to the east along a small mountain road to the tri-valley area. hopefully to find help there. Or from there drive to the south to LA or north to canada, along high way 5.</p>
<h2 id="emergency-communication-plan">6. Emergency Communication Plan</h2>
<p><em>Describe the plan for communication within your family</em></p>
<p>We will use cell phone to communicate. walkie-talkie.</p>
<p><em>describe how you will receive messages from authorities in the area.</em></p>
<p>radio. check internet if possible.</p>
<p><em>Provide a back-up plan in the event you cannot use your cell phone or other wireless devices.</em></p>
<p>walkie-talkie if small distance. communicate via wechat when internet is available.</p>
<h2 id="maintenance-approach">7. Maintenance Approach</h2>
<p><em>Develop a strategy to keep your plan up to date in the coming months and years. For example, how will you assure that the medications or water in your Jump Kit are up to date?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>monthly readiness practice</li>
<li>monthly home intrusion dry-run practice</li>
<li>shooting range practice at least monthly for all adult family members</li>
<li>check foods in the emergency knit and replace with new ones and consume the old ones if possible.</li>
<li>periodically check expiration date of medicines and dispose / replace.</li>
</ul>
